## FAQ
<b>Q: Why KAST?</b>  
<i>A: KAST is an abbreviation of Kirill And Sanya Translation.</i><br></br>

<b>Q: What does the logo mean?</b>  
<i>A: The logo doesn't mean anything - it was generated by a neural network.</i><br></br>

<b>In: How did the site come about?</b>  
<i>A: The site appeared as a project for one of the courses at the university: Sasha offered to do something for tournaments at the computer club, and Kirill remembered that he had once planned to create his own HLTV for his tournaments - and it turned out that way.</i><br></br>

<b>Q: So you stole the site?</b>  
<i>A: We hope that this is not the case. We were really inspired by HLTV, as it is the only resource that focuses on watching matches and combines information about tournaments, players and much more. Yes, we have retained the HLTV structure, but at the same time we have brought our vision to the project - the site combines not only the HLTV features described above, but also the ability to create teams and participate in tournaments.</i><br></br>

<b>Q: What is KAST's goal?</b>  
<i>A: We want to enter the amateur tournament market and raise their level. We want amateur players to touch the level of organization of professional tournaments.</i><br></br>

<b>Q: Why are there so few commits in the repository?</b>  
<i>A: This repository is a merger of two old ones: backend and frontend, since initially each part of the service was located in its own repository.</i><br></br>

<b>Q: How do I enable English on the website?</b>  
<i>A: Currently, only Russian is available.</i>
